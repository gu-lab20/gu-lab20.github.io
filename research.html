				Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common pediatric malignancy and remains a leading cause of childhood cancer death. ALL consists of multiple subtypes with distinct constellations of inherited and somatic genetic alterations. Chromosomal rearrangements leading to oncogene deregulation define multiple ALL subtypes that are of central importance for diagnosis, classification, prognostication, and therapeutic decision-making. With advances in next-generation sequencing technology, especially transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq), recurrent gene rearrangements driving leukemogenesis through expression of chimeric fusion transcripts have been identified through genomic studies. This has led to revised classification system of ALL and the identification of novel therapeutic targets (e.g. kinase inhibition in Ph-like ALL). However, approximately 10-30% of ALL cases, depending on age, cannot be categorized into any of the currently established subtypes. Such “uncategorized” cases commonly relapse and lack targeted therapeutic approaches.<br/>
				In our recent work, we performed integrative genomic analysis including RNA-seq of 1,988 B-cell ALL (B-ALL) and analyzed chromosomal rearrangements, gene-expression profiles (GEP), somatic mutations and chromosome-level copy-number alterations. Based on genetic alterations and gene expression profiling, we classified 23 B-ALL subtypes, including 8 novel ones. Two novel subtypes are shown with distinct GEP characterized by PAX5 alterations. One, herein termed PAX5 altered (PAX5alt), comprised 148 (7.4%) cases, was characterized by diverse PAX5 alterations including rearrangements (n=57), sequence mutations (n=46) and/or focal intragenic amplifications (n=8). These PAX5 alterations were found in 73.6% of PAX5alt cases and different alteration types were mutually exclusive. The other GEP distinct subtype comprised 44 cases, all with PAX5 P80R missense mutations. To examine the effects of PAX5 P80R on B-cell maturation, WT PAX5, PAX5 P80R, V26G and P34Q were expressed in Pax5-/- lineage-depleted bone marrow cells. Expression of WT PAX5, PAX5 V26G and P34Q resulted in near complete rescue of B cell differentiation; however, expression of PAX5 P80R blocked the differentiation at the pre-pro-B stage of B-cell maturation. Further, Pax5 P80R heterozygous or homozygous mice developed pre-B-ALL with a median latency of 166 and 87 days, respectively.<br/>
				Our results show the utility of RNA-seq in defining subtypes and founding genetic alterations in ALL, provide a revised taxonomy of the disease across the age spectrum, and reinforce the central role of PAX5 as a checkpoint in B lymphoid maturation and leukemogenesis. 
				To better understand the genetic and cellular heterogeneity of each leukemia subtype and develop novel targeted therapies, the Gu Lab will conduct research focusing on the following areas:<br/>
