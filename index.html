				<p>
					Dr. Zhaohui Gu received his bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering from Xi'an Jiao Tong University in 2008, then he joined Dr. Zhu Chen's laboratory for his Ph.D. training at Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. After receiving a Ph.D. degree in Bioinformatics, he joined Dr. Charles Mullighan's group at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital as a postdoctoral fellow in 2015. His research has led to 13 first/co-first authored publications on Nature, Nature Genetics, Nature Communications, Bioinformatics, PNAS, etc. He has been supported by the ASH Scholar Award, LLS Special Fellow Award, and NIH/NCI K99/R00 Award. From June 29th, 2020, Dr. Gu will start his own lab at City of Hope National Medical Center as an assistant professor.<br>
					Over the past 10 years, Gu led discoveries of driver genetic lesions in multiple blood cancers (co-first in <i><b>Nature Genetics</b></i>, 2011; <i><b>Nature Genetics</b></i>, 2015; and <i><b>PNAS</b></i>, 2014), developed bioinformatics tools to facilitate cancer genomic studies (Gu et al., <i><b>Bioinformatics</b></i>, 2018), and defined mutational spectrum of multiple high-risk acute leukemias (Gu et al., <i><b>Nature Communications</b></i>, 2016; co-first, <i><b>Nature</b></i>, 2018; co-first, <i><b>Blood Cancer Discovery</b></i>, 2020). In a recent large-scale study of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; 1988 cases), Gu identified multiple novel ALL subtypes and developed CRISPR knock-in mouse model to study a novel subtype driven by PAX5 P80R mutation (Gu et al., <i><b>Nature Genetics</b></i>, 2019).
