								<li> 2020-Present: Assistant Professor, City of hope </li>
								<li> 2015-2020: St Jude Children&apos;s Research Hospital </li>
								<li> 2008-2014: Shanghai Jiao Tong University </li>
								<li> 2004-2008: Xi&apos;an Jiao Tong University </li> <br>
								<p>Dr. Zhaohui Gu received his bachelor&apos;s degree in biomedical engineering from Xi&apos;an Jiao Tong University in 2008, then he joined Dr. Zhu Chen&apos;s laboratory for his Ph.D. training at Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. After receiving a Ph.D. degree in bioinformatics, he joined Dr. Charles Mullighan&apos;s group at St. Jude Children&apos;s Research Hospital as a postdoctoral fellow in 2015. His research has led to 13 first/co-first authored publications on Nature, Nature Genetics, Nature Communications, Bioinformatics, PNAS, etc. He has been supported by ASH Scholar Award, LLS Special Fellow Award, and NIH/NCI K99/R00 Award. From June 29th, 2020, Dr. Gu will set up his own lab at City of Hope National Medical Center as an assistant professor.
								</p>
								<p><b>Our mission and vision</b><br>
								Gu lab is devoted to developing cutting-edge computational methods to analyze multi-omics data of various hematologic malignancies, with a focus on disease classification, driver genetic lesion identification and functional assay of leukemogenesis. Over the past 10 years, Gu led discoveries of driver genetic lesions in multiple blood cancers (co-first in 2011 <i><b>Nature Genetics</b></i>, 2015 <i><b>Nature Genetics</b></i> and 2014 <i><b>PNAS</b></i>), developed bioinformatics tools to facilitate cancer genomic studies (Gu et al, 2018 <i><b>Bioinformatics</b></i>), and defined mutational spectrum of multiple high-risk acute leukemias (Gu et al., 2016 <i><b>Nature Communications</b></i>; co-first, 2018 <i><b>Nature</b></i>; co-first, 2020 <i><b>Blood Cancer Discovery</b></i>). In a recent large-scale study of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; 1988 cases), Gu identified multiple novel ALL subtypes and developed CRISPR knock-in mouse model to study a novel subtype driven by PAX5 P80R mutation (Gu et al., 2019 <i><b>Nature Genetics</b></i>). More research regarding his research can be found at:
								<a href="https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=lKPYa8YAAAAJ" target="_blank">https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=lKPYa8YAAAAJ</a> 

								<p>To better understand the genetic and cellular heterogeneity of each leukemia subtype and develop novel targeted therapies, Gu lab will conduct research focusing on the following areas:
								<strong>
									<li> Identify novel leukemia subtypes and develop clinically applicable classification system </li>
									<li> Curate and maintain well-annotated leukemia genomic databases to serve as a public resource </li>
									<li> Develop machine-learning based bioinformatics tools for leukemia/cancer genomic analysis </li>
									<li> Study the mechanism of leukemogenesis and develop therapeutic strategies for each leukemia subtype </li>
								</strong>
								In Gu lab, computational and wet-lab trainees will work closely to generate new datasets, test hypothesis, identify and solve novel biological and clinical problems.
								</p>

								<p><b>Postdoc Research Fellows</b><br>
								Multiple postdoc positions (bioinformatics and/or biology) are available in Dr. Zhaohui Gu&apos;s lab in the Department of Computational and Quantitative Medicine (primary) and Systems Biology (joint) at City of Hope National Medical Center.</p>
								<p><b>Candidate qualifications</b><br>
								The openings are ideal for PhD graduates pursuing a career in biomedical research or industry. Ideal applicants are expected to have PhD degree or equivalent at the time of accepting this offer. PhD training in Bioinformatics, Computer Science, Statistics, Cell/Molecular/Developmental biology, immunology, hematology or other quantitative and/or biomedical science are all encouraged to apply. Any prior experience in cancer genomics/biology, bioinformatics analysis, molecular mechanism study, mouse modeling, etc. are highly valued. Responsibilities of the position will include but not limited to: <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> modeling of genetic alterations, customized sequencing library preparation, computational methodology development, analysis of big genomic and biomedical data, manuscript writing, postdoc fellowship application, research work presentation, etc.<br>

								<p><b>To apply</b><br>
								Applicants are welcome to submit a CV with full list of publications, a cover letter of training background and future research plans, and contact information of at least three references to Zhaohui (Zhaohui.Gu@stjude.org; <b><i>to gzhmat@gmail.com after June 1st</i></b>). The application package should be in one PDF file named in the format as &quot;(expected) graduation year/month + name + major&quot;. Any questions or inquiries are also welcome before sending the final application.<br>

								<p><b>What we offer</b><br>
								The research programs in Gu lab aim for fostering the trainees from both dry- and wet-lab aspects to develop strong expertise and track-record for future academia or industry positions. The lab space is in the Systems Biology Department, which is an interdisciplinary and highly collaborative research community. This lab is supported by generous funding (NIH/NCI R00 grant and startup package) and has access to powerful computing and data storage resource (&gt;5,600 cores, &gt;8 petabyte storage and 56 NVIDIA V100) and abundant cancer patient samples. We will provide full support and comprehensive mentorship to guarantee the trainees a productive, enjoyable, and balanced research and personal life.
								City of Hope, as a designated Comprehensive Cancer Center by the NCI and a founding member of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), is ranked the 11th best adult cancer hospital in the nation by U.S. News &amp; World Report&apos;s 2019-20 Best Hospitals.<br>

								<p>The first webpage of Gu Lab is online. It's not fancy, but very informative, if not too much. Web-development is a hair-pulling experience for me. No wonder they are highly-paid. For now, this webpage is solely serving the goal of recruiting lab members, but it will evolve into a hub to host and present our future research and life. A nice photo of the PI is necessary</p>

								<p>Today, the official offer from the City of Hope is accepted, which announces that Gu lab will kick-start on June 29th, 2020. As the PI, I am thrilled to lead a highly motivated and collaborative team to pursue the wildest research ambitions. Talented postdoc candidates are invited to embark on the inaugural of Gu lab. Together, we can lead a productive, memorable and enjoyable research life in beautiful Los Angeles!</p>
